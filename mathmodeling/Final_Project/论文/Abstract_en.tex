The total retail sales of social consumer goods(TRS) is an important barometer to measure people's consumption level, and it is also an important barometer in the national economic.
TRS lost in 2022 can be applied to be a key factor of the overall economic loss.

This article first decomposes the STL seasonal decomposition of the previous monthly statistics to obtain the seasonal fluctuations of the time sequence.
After that make a first-order difference on the original time sequence, and then the seasons differential on the sequence of the differential sequence to obtain
a smooth time sequence. Then perform parameter estimation through seasonal Arima models, and
get the prediction value of without epidemic intervention in 2022. Then use the data before 2020 to establish the ARIMA model to obtain the predicted value 
that has not been affected by the epidemic in 2020. Utilize 2020
Forecast values and actual values to do intervention analysis modeling based on epidemic intervention. Then apply the model to get the
predictive value in 2022 during pandemic intervention. Finally, the loss of TRS in 2022 can be forecasted by combining with the prediction value of the Arima model.
Use the R language model and calculate and plot.
